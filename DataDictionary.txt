                  Developed by Bruce Aker   1/11/16 - 1/21/16

All units either °F, inches, or percent (for pop1, pop2, dly-prcp-pctall, dly-snow-pctall)

GENERAL
COOPID - Weather station ID, 6 digits, sometimes prefaced with USC00
Error = forecasted – observed (for temperatures)
ICAO Code/ID - Identifier for weather station (e.g. KSEA for Seattle Tacoma airport)
STNID - (weather) station ID, issued by NCEI (formerly NCDC), 8 digits
stn_id_cdo - (weather) station ID needed by CDO website (WBAN, COOP,...), prefaced with a key, e.g. GHCND:USW00024243, COOP:USC00123456
WBANID - Weather station ID, 5 digits, sometimes prefaced with USW000
Wea_stn_cd – ICAO weather station code/ID (e.g. KSEA for Seattle-Tacoma airport)
Weather number – value for tmax, tmin, prcp, snow, predicted min/max temp, POP
Z = UTC, e.g. 1425Z = 14:25 UTC (Universal Coordinated Time)

FORECASTS
Forecast_Day – 3 thru 7 days ahead (WPC medium range forecasts)
Forecast_Type – Min/max temp or POP
Issue date – date forecast was issued
MAX_3 – predicted maximum temperature 3 days ahead (resolution 1°F)
MAX_7 – predicted maximum temperature 7 days ahead (resolution 1°F)
MIN_3 – predicted minimum temperature 3 days ahead (resolution 1°F)
MIN_7 – predicted minimum temperature 7 days ahead (resolution 1°F)
POP1 – Probability of Precipitation (>= 0.01") at 1200Z (percent)
POP2 – Probability of Precipitation (>= 0.01") at 0000Z (percent)
Valid date – date forecast is valid for (YYYYMMDD)
Valid_date_calcd – calculated from issue date and forecast day (e.g. 3,4,5,6,7) (YYYYMMDD)
wea_num - value for forecasted min/max temp, POP

OBSERVABLES – actual weather data
prcp - observed rain amount, does not include snow, resolution ~0.004 inches
snow - observed snowfall amount, resolution ~0.04 inches
tmax – observed max temp, resolution ~0.2°F
tmin – observed min temp, resolution ~0.2°F
Valid date – date observation was made (YYYYMMDD)
wea_num_type - tmax, tmin, prcp, snow
wea_num - value for tmax, tmin, prcp, snow

DAILY NORMALS (calculated from 1981 - 2010; resolutions: temperature 0.1°F, precipitation 0.01", snowfall 0.1", probability 0.1%)
(dly-)tmax-normal - Long-term averages of daily maximum temperature
(dly-)tmax-stddev - Long-term standard deviations of daily maximum temperature
(dly-)tmin-normal - Long-term averages of daily minimum temperature
(dly-)tmin-stddev - Long-term standard deviations of daily minimum temperature
(dly-)prcp-50pctl - 50th percentiles of daily nonzero precipitation totals for 29-day windows centered on each day of the year
(dly-)prcp-pctall - Probability of precipitation >= 0.01 inches for 29-day windows centered on each day of the year (aka DLY-PRCP-PCTALL-GE001HI)
(dly-)snow-50pctl - 50th percentiles of daily nonzero snowfall totals for 29-day windows centered on each day of the year
(dly-)snow-pctall - Probability of snowfall >= 0.1 inches for 29-day windows centered on each day of the year (aka DLY-SNOW-PCTALL-GE001TI)
Valid_day - day of the year for which normal applies (MMDD)
wea_num_type - dly-tmax-normal, dly-tmax-stddev, dly-tmin-normal, dly-tmin-stddev, dly-prcp-50pctl, dly-prcp-pctall, dly-snow-50pctl, dly-snow-pctall
